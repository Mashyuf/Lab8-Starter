## How are graceful degradation and service workers related
Both graceful degradation and service workers increases accessibility and user experience. Both allows the website or application to still be mostly operational even though the user doesn't have the required specs. Such as when an user lost internet access, they are still able to access a site through service workers. Service workers can be a section of graceful degradation, as service workers helps to implement the ideas of gradeful degradation. But the scope of graceful degradation doesn't stop at just service workers.
